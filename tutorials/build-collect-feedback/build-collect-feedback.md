[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a new study)]
To create a new survey to send out to your end users, you will have to create a new study. To create a new study, click the **Create Study** button in the top tool bar in the UI Editor or on the prototype overview page. (if you don't have a prototype now, please follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/superwangnan/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/build-create-prototype/build-create-prototype.md) to create one)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Add a new question)]
Studies have an out of the box question to provide general sentiment and comments about the application. You can add additional questions if you want users to look more in depth into certain features.

Create a new question that will test the navigation and placement of data on the screen. Click **New Question**.

![new question button on feedback creation page](3.png)

You can add questions about Images or Prototypes in your project. Select **Prototypes**.

![prototypes link on new question form](4.png)

Select **Prototype 1** from the list and then click **Select**.

![select button highlighted](5.png)

There are 4 types of questions you can ask: annotation, comment, multiple choice, and navigation. Select **Select Answer(s) from multiple choice**. You must provide at least 2 options for multiple choice, but you can supply more than 2 answers.

![new question type and details](6.png)

Set the question to see if users can find the specified demand of a part for the Flying Car. **Here is a sample question**:

```
What is the demand for Flying Car's Bumper?
```

The correct answer for this is 450. **Set the options** to 250 (the availability of the part), 450 (the correct demand), and 700 (the demand for a part on the initial screen).

```
Choices:
 - 250
 - 450
 - 700
```
